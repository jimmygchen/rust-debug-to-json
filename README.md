# Rust Debug Format to JSON Converter

A simple web tool that converts Rust's `Debug` output to JSON, making it easier to work with Rust data structures in JSON format.

## Usage

While logging complex structures with `Debug` output is typically avoided due to clutter, it can be useful during testing and debugging. For specific tasks, like checking list lengths or finding elements in large nested structs, it may be useful to convert the data to a common parsable format like JSON for ease of analysis.

## Example Conversions

### Enum with Struct Data

**Input:**

The enum name is not part of the default `Debug` output, e.g. `Deneb` is the enum variant name here. Therefore it's treated similarly to a struct.

```
Deneb(BeaconBlockHeader { field: 123 })
```

**Converted JSON:**

```json
{
  "type": "Deneb",
  "values": [
    {
      "type": "BeaconBlockHeader",
      "field": 123
    }
  ]
}
```

### Option

**Input:**

```
MyStruct { optional_field: Some("present") }
```

**Converted JSON:**

```json
{
  "type": "MyStruct",
  "optional_field": "present"  // or `null` for `None`
}
```

### Struct with Positional Fields

**Input:**

```
Slot(13024)
```

**Converted JSON:**

```json
{
  "type": "Slot",
  "values": [13024]
}
```

## Known issues

This is a naive implementation mostly generated by AI. It works for basic structures, but there are some known issues:
- It does not currently parse nested complex types correctly.
- `PhantomData` is not currently handled.
